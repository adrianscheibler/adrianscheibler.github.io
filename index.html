        <p><strong>Welcome!</strong></p>
        <p>
          I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the Harvard University Department of Government. At Harvard, I am an affiliate to the
          <a href="https://ces.fas.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies</a>,
          where I co-chair the
          <a href="https://ces.fas.harvard.edu/study-groups/graduate-student-research-workshop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Graduate Student Research Workshop</a>,
          the <a href="https://caps.gov.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Center for American Political Science</a>,
          and the <a href="https://www.iq.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Institute for Quantitative Social Science</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          My research is broadly situated within comparative political economy and political behavior, with a focus on inequalities and participation in advanced capitalist democracies. I am particularly interested in the impact of the knowledge economy transition on rural areas. I use a range of methods ranging from interviews and ethnography to causal inference.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prior to coming to Harvard, I received a B.A. in international relations (with honors in democracy, development, and the rule of law) and a M.A. in public policy from Stanford University. I have also worked at the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs of Switzerland.
